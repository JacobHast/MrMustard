# Structure of MrMustard
MrMustard is split into four components: the [abstract](https://github.com/XanaduAI/MrMustard/tree/abstract_backend/mrmustard/abstract) classes,
the [concrete](https://github.com/XanaduAI/MrMustard/tree/abstract_backend/mrmustard/concrete) classes,
the [plugins](https://github.com/XanaduAI/MrMustard/tree/abstract_backend/mrmustard/plugins) and
the [backends](https://github.com/XanaduAI/MrMustard/tree/abstract_backend/mrmustard/backends).
We also have a utils module, which is planned to be deprecated.

 âœ… Always write new [tests](https://github.com/XanaduAI/MrMustard/tree/abstract_backend/mrmustard/tests) if you are adding new functionality.

## 1. Abstract base classes
Abstract base classes cannot be instantiated, as they are abstract.
At the moment the main abstract classes are:

- [`Parametrized`](https://github.com/XanaduAI/MrMustard/blob/abstract_backend/mrmustard/abstract/parametrized.py) (functionality for all parametrized objects (Ops, Detectors, etc...))
- [`State`](https://github.com/XanaduAI/MrMustard/blob/abstract_backend/mrmustard/abstract/state.py) (abstract parent class for all types of states (Vacuum, Coherent, etc...))
- [`Op`](https://github.com/XanaduAI/MrMustard/blob/abstract_backend/mrmustard/abstract/op.py) (abstract parent class for gates and Gaussian detectors)
- [`Detector`](https://github.com/XanaduAI/MrMustard/blob/abstract_backend/mrmustard/abstract/detector.py) (abstract parent class for non-Gaussian detectors (PNRs, Threshold, etc...))

Unless it's for a bug or a planned feature, we don't expect to touch these classes very often.

## 2. Concrete classes
Concrete classes are the specific:

- [States](https://github.com/XanaduAI/MrMustard/blob/abstract_backend/mrmustard/concrete/states.py) (Vacuum, Coherent, etc...)
- [Ops](https://github.com/XanaduAI/MrMustard/blob/abstract_backend/mrmustard/concrete/ops.py) (like Squeezers, Homodyne detectors, etc...)
- [Detectors](https://github.com/XanaduAI/MrMustard/blob/abstract_backend/mrmustard/concrete/measurements.py) (like PNRs, Threshold, etc...)

To develop additional concrete classes, determine which type of object you are implementing 
(e.g. a new gate) and add it to the appropriate file, 
following the conventions you see holding for other similar objects.

## 3. Plugins
Plugins add functionality to the concrete classes by composition, without committing to a specific numerical library
(which is instead handled by the backend). At the moment the main plugins are:

- [`SymplecticPlugin`](https://github.com/XanaduAI/MrMustard/blob/abstract_backend/mrmustard/plugins/symplecticplugin.py) (phase space functionality)
- [`FockPlugin`](https://github.com/XanaduAI/MrMustard/blob/abstract_backend/mrmustard/plugins/fockplugin.py) (Fock space functionality)
- [`TrainPlugin`](https://github.com/XanaduAI/MrMustard/blob/abstract_backend/mrmustard/plugins/trainplugin.py) (optimization functionality)

To develop the existing plugins (or to add new ones) one needs to make sure that the backend is used when calling numerical math methods, e.g. `backend.transpose(M)`.

To refactor plugins, 

## 4. Backends
The numerical functionality (be it with autodiff or not) is supplied by the backends.

To write a new backend (e.g. at the time of writing we don't have a pytorch backend) 
one needs to create a new directory inside [`backends/`](https://github.com/XanaduAI/MrMustard/tree/abstract_backend/mrmustard/backends) for the new backend and implement
a concrete backend according to `BackendInterface` (implemented
in [`backends/__init__.py`](https://github.com/XanaduAI/MrMustard/blob/abstract_backend/mrmustard/backends/__init__.py)).

To refactor backends, functionality can build on methods in the same backend.
If all of the methods are in the same backend, then it can be moved in the `BackendInterface`.

New plugins can be created if necessary.
