This module contains the base classes for the available quantum states.

In the docstrings defining the available states we provide a definition in terms of
the covariance matrix :math:`V` and the vector of means :math:`r`. Additionally, we
provide the ``(A, b, c)`` triples that define the states in the Fock Bargmann
representation.
